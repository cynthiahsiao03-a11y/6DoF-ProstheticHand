<h2>Description</h2>
As part of IGEN 330, I worked on a team developing a low-cost, 6-DOF myoelectric prosthetic hand based on the Talos robotic hand platform. Our goal was to redesign the system for prosthetic use while improving affordability, modularity, and intuitive control. I contributed to the mechanical redesign of the wrist to integrate an Electronic Quick Connect (EQC), enabling secure attachment and reliable power/signal transfer. Structural performance was validated using FEA under a 300 N palm load to ensure durability.

Electronic Quick Connect (EQC):  <br/>
<img src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/868328641946329128/1473427175926530340/image.png?ex=69962b7d&is=6994d9fd&hm=3ac6e234462e18fd02bb62c4ebef1ccc9d2572d1a8fe4e093983b0e784e29d14&=&format=webp&quality=lossless&width=1196&height=562" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>

I led the mechanical integration of an Electronic Quick Connect (EQC) into the prosthetic wrist, enabling secure attachment to a socket while transferring power and communication signals between the hand and control system.

Because the wrist experiences the highest bending loads during grasping, I redesigned the wrist–frame interface to improve load transfer and reduce stress concentrations. The updated design used interlocking geometry and increased bearing surface area to shift loads away from fasteners and improve structural robustness. Finite Element Analysis (FEA) was conducted under a 300 N palm load to validate durability and guide geometry refinement.

The redesign also prioritized minimizing added length from the EQC to preserve anatomical proportions, reducing weight through strategic material removal, and maintaining manufacturability through additive manufacturing (palm/frame). This work ensured the EQC was structurally integrated without compromising strength, usability, or serviceability.

I contributed to the integration and assembly of the Talos-based 6-DOF prosthetic hand into a modular, wearable system that combined mechanical structure, embedded electronics, and control hardware.
<p align="center">
The hand was mounted to a custom wrist and palm assembly that housed intermediate electronics and interfaced with industry-standard prosthetic components, ensuring compatibility with conventional socket systems. The design emphasized modular subassemblies to simplify servicing, battery access, and electronics troubleshooting.
<p align="center">
To support real-user testing, we developed a wearable demonstration jig that allowed non-amputee testers to safely evaluate control, weight distribution, and balance before full socket integration. Multiple concepts were evaluated using a decision matrix, and a parallel-hand configuration was selected to reduce bending loads and improve realistic weight perception.

The final demonstration device enabled structured usability testing and live validation of the integrated mechanical and myoelectric control systems.

<br />
To ensure the redesigned wrist and EQC interface could withstand real-world loading, I conducted structural verification using Finite Element Analysis (FEA). The primary validation case simulated a 300 N quasi-static palm load to represent pushing or weight-bearing through the hand.
<p align="center">
The analysis compared baseline and updated wrist designs, evaluating:
- Maximum von Mises stress
- Peak displacement and overall deflection
- Reaction forces at mounting interfaces
- Estimated factor of safety
